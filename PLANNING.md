## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

   - Mitigation: Start with basic offline, enhance later

3. **Payment Integration**
   - Mitigation: Use Stripe's proven patterns

### Business Risks
1. **Slow User Adoption**
   - Mitigation: Beta user feedback loop
   
2. **Feature Creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict MVP scope

3. **Competition**
   - Mitigation: Focus on trainer experience

## Key Decisions Needed

### Immediate (This Week)
- [ ] Choose hosting platform
- [ ] Finalize database hosting (Supabase vs. custom)
- [ ] Set up development environment

### Before Beta

- [ ] Beta user recruitment strategy
- [ ] Marketing website approach

### Long-term
- [ ] Mobile app timeline
- [ ] International expansion
- [ ] Enterprise features

## Next Steps

3. **Next Week**: Begin Epic 001 (User Profiles)
4. **Month 1**: Have working authentication + profiles + client management

## Notes
- Focus on trainer needs first, client features second
- Prioritize stability over features
- Get to beta quickly for real feedback
- Document as we build
