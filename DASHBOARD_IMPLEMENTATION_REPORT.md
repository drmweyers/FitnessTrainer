  - **Quick Trainer Actions**: Create program, add client, view calendar, client reports
  - **Recent Activity Feed**: Client workouts, milestones, program updates

#### 6. Client Dashboard (`/dashboard/client`)
- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/client/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - **Today's Workout**: Current day's scheduled workout with details and start button
  - **Progress Summary**: Workout streaks, total workouts, personal records, weight tracking
  - **Active Program Details**: Current program progress, trainer info, next workout
  - **Weekly Schedule**: Upcoming workouts with types and timing
  - **Recent Workout History**: Past workouts with ratings, duration, and notes
  - **Quick Client Actions**: Start workout, log progress, view programs, message trainer
  - **Progress Tracking**: Weight goals, measurements, achievement milestones

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Authentication**: Integration with existing AuthContext
- **State Management**: React hooks with mock data (ready for API integration)

### Route Protection
- All dashboard routes are protected with authentication checks
- Role-based access control prevents unauthorized access
- Automatic redirects for unauthenticated users
- Graceful handling of loading states

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- Grid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interfaces for mobile users
- Consistent spacing and typography

### Component Reusability
- Shared components reduce code duplication
- Consistent design language across all dashboards
- Modular architecture for easy maintenance
- TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety

## Mock Data Structure

### Admin Dashboard Mock Data
```typescript
- System metrics (users, trainers, clients, revenue)
- User growth analytics
- Recent signups with status
- System health indicators
- Platform usage statistics
```

### Trainer Dashboard Mock Data
```typescript
- Client overview statistics
- Program performance metrics
- Upcoming sessions with client details
- Individual client progress tracking
- Recent activities and milestones
```

### Client Dashboard Mock Data
```typescript
- Today's scheduled workout
- Progress summary with streaks
- Active program information
- Weekly workout schedule
- Recent workout history with ratings
```
