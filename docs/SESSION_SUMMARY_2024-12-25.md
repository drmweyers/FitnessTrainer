# Session Summary - December 25, 2024

## Session Overview
This session focused on preparing for DigitalOcean deployment of the FitnessTrainer (EvoFit) application and adding new workout video flow features. Key activities included:

1. **Documentation Updates**
   - Removed all meal planning/recipe features from architecture.md
   - Created comprehensive DigitalOcean deployment guides
   - Added workout video flow features to PRD and architecture documents

2. **Deployment Infrastructure Planning**
   - Created DO_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md based on FitnessMealPlanner's proven deployment process
   - Created DEPLOYMENT_PROCESS_DOCUMENTATION.md with detailed step-by-step instructions
   - Created app.yaml for DigitalOcean App Platform configuration
   - Created deployment setup scripts (deploy-setup.sh and deploy-setup.ps1)

3. **Current Infrastructure Status**
   - DigitalOcean CLI (doctl) installed and authenticated
   - Container registry "bci" already exists (from other projects)
   - Multiple existing apps deployed on DigitalOcean
   - PostgreSQL database infrastructure available

## Key Decision Made
**Decision**: Build first, deploy later (Option B)
- Focus on implementing the authentication system (Epic 002) before setting up deployment
- Get basic frontend and backend working locally first
- Return to deployment once there's a working application to deploy

## New Features Added: Workout Video Flow
### FR-014: Workout Video Flow & Export
Added comprehensive features for creating seamless workout videos:

1. **Video Flow Builder**
   - Drag-and-drop interface to sequence exercises
   - Customizable timers for each exercise
   - Rest period configuration
   - Intro/outro segments with trainer branding
   - Real-time preview functionality

2. **Multi-Platform Playback**
   - In-app web player with full controls
   - Cast to TV support (Chromecast & AirPlay)
   - Mobile-optimized responsive player
   - Picture-in-picture mode

3. **Export Capabilities**
   - YouTube integration with automatic upload
   - Multiple file format exports (MP4, MOV, WebM)
   - Resolution options (720p, 1080p, 4K)
   - Custom branding and watermarks

4. **Advanced Timer System**
   - Multiple timer types (countdown, interval, AMRAP, EMOM, Tabata)
   - Visual and audio cues
   - Auto-advance between exercises
   - Total workout time tracking

### Technical Implementation Added
- Video processing pipeline using FFmpeg
- Casting architecture for TV streaming
- YouTube API integration
- HLS adaptive streaming support
- CDN strategy for video delivery

## Project Status Assessment
- **Backend**: Only basic package.json exists, no dependencies or code
- **Frontend**: Directory exists but no code
- **Database**: Schema not yet defined
- **Authentication**: Not yet implemented (first priority)

## Development Plan Created
Created todo list for authentication implementation:
1. Set up backend dependencies and TypeScript
2. Set up database schema with Prisma
3. Implement JWT authentication
4. Create authentication API endpoints
5. Set up frontend with Next.js
6. Build authentication UI components
7. Connect frontend to backend
8. Add basic 2FA setup

## Files Created/Modified This Session

### Created Files:
1. **DO_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - Quick reference deployment guide
2. **DEPLOYMENT_PROCESS_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Detailed deployment process
3. **app.yaml** - DigitalOcean App Platform specification
4. **scripts/deploy-setup.sh** - Bash deployment setup script
5. **scripts/deploy-setup.ps1** - PowerShell deployment setup script

### Modified Files:
1. **docs/architecture.md** - Removed all meal planning features and added workout video flow architecture
2. **docs/PLANNING.md** - Previously updated with current project status
3. **docs/CLAUDE.md** - Previously created with development guidelines
4. **docs/PRD.md** - Added FR-014: Workout Video Flow & Export features

## Next Steps for Development
1. **Immediate**: Start authentication implementation
   - Install backend dependencies (Express, TypeScript, Prisma, JWT)
   - Set up PostgreSQL database locally
   - Create Prisma schema for users and authentication

2. **This Week**: Complete Epic 002 (Authentication)
   - JWT authentication with refresh tokens
   - User registration/login endpoints
   - Password reset flow
   - Basic 2FA setup

3. **Following Week**: Begin Epic 001 (User Profiles)

   - Health questionnaire
   - Goal setting
   - Profile photos

## Deployment Readiness Checklist (For Future Reference)
When ready to deploy, ensure:
- [ ] All environment variables configured in DigitalOcean
- [ ] Database created and connection tested
- [ ] Container registry accessible
- [ ] Domain name configured (if using custom domain)
- [ ] SSL certificate provisioned
- [ ] Dockerfile created and tested locally
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Exercise database files included in build
- [ ] All API keys and secrets configured

## Important Notes
- The deployment infrastructure is well-documented and ready to use
- Following the same proven patterns as FitnessMealPlanner
- DigitalOcean authentication is already set up and working
- Container registry "bci" can be reused for this project
- Focus should remain on building core functionality before deployment

## Session End State
- Project is ready for development to begin
- All deployment documentation is prepared for when needed
- Clear path forward with authentication as the first implementation priority
- BMAD phase is complete, development phase beginning
