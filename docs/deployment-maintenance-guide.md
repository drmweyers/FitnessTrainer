# Deployment & Maintenance Guide

## Phase 5: Deployment & Maintenance

### Action
Guide the User through the complete deployment process with detailed explanations at each step.

## Pre-Deployment Process (CTO Checklist)

### Pre-Deployment Tasks
- **Testing**: "Running complete test suite to ensure everything works..."
- **Build Verification**: "Building production version to verify no compile errors..."
- **Security Check**: "Scanning for exposed secrets or sensitive data..."
- **Change Review**: "Here's a summary of what we're deploying: [detailed list]"
- **User Confirmation**: "Ready to deploy. Should I proceed?"

## GitHub Release Process

### CTO Explanation
"I'm creating a tagged release in GitHub to document this deployment"

### Commands with Explanations
```bash
# CTO: "Committing final changes"
git add . && git commit -m "feat(release): prepare v1.0.0"

# CTO: "Pushing to GitHub"
git push origin main

# CTO: "Creating release tag"
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0

# CTO: "Creating GitHub release with notes"
gh release create v1.0.0 --notes "Release notes here"
```

## Deployment Methods

### 1. Container-Based Deployment (Docker)
#### CTO Process
- "Building production Docker image..."
- "Tagging image for registry..."
- "Pushing to container registry..."
- "Triggering deployment..."

#### Manual Fallback
If automated deployment fails, CTO guides through manual dashboard deployment

### 2. Platform-Specific Deployment
- **Vercel/Netlify**: "Pushing to main branch will trigger automatic deployment"
- **AWS/Azure**: "Using CLI to deploy: [specific commands]"
- **DigitalOcean**: "Accessing app platform for deployment"
- **Heroku**: "Using Git-based deployment: git push heroku main"

### 3. Traditional Server Deployment
- **SSH Access**: "Connecting to production server..."
- **Code Update**: "Pulling latest changes from GitHub..."
- **Service Restart**: "Restarting application services..."

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Verification Steps
- **Health Checks**: "Verifying application is responding..."
- **Functionality Tests**: "Testing core features work correctly..."
- **Performance Monitoring**: "Checking response times and resource usage..."
- **Error Monitoring**: "Reviewing logs for any errors..."

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Detection
"Issue detected in deployment. Initiating rollback..."

### Manual Rollback Steps
1. "Reverting to previous version in deployment platform"
2. "Or using Git: `git checkout [previous-version]`"
3. "Rebuilding and redeploying previous version"

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Updates
- Schedule and plan updates
- Always test in staging environment first
- Prepare rollback plan before deployment

### Database Migrations
- Handle with care, always backup first
- Test migrations on staging data
- Plan downtime windows if necessary
- Have rollback scripts ready

### Security Patches
- Apply promptly with testing
- Monitor security advisories
- Update dependencies regularly
- Scan for vulnerabilities

### Performance Optimization
- Monitor and improve as needed
- Regular performance audits
- Database optimization
- CDN and caching strategies

## CTO Communication Style During Deployment

### Communication Guidelines
- **Status Updates**: "Step 1 of 5: Building application... (2-3 minutes)"
- **Error Handling**: "Encountered issue: [explanation]. Trying alternative approach..."
- **Success Confirmation**: "Deployment successful! Application live at [URL]"
- **Next Steps**: "Monitoring for 15 minutes to ensure stability..."

## Advanced Multi-Agent Frameworks
- **"Super Claude" Framework**: Consider community-built frameworks that provide structured commands, flags, and personas (front-end, backend, security) for comprehensive developer workflows
- **Custom Command Sets**: Develop project-specific slash commands for common multi-agent workflows
- **Agent Orchestration Patterns**: Define standard patterns for agent collaboration (sequential, parallel, hierarchical)

## Production Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Uptime**: Application availability
- **Response Time**: API and page load speeds
- **Error Rates**: 4xx and 5xx HTTP errors
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, disk, network
- **Database Performance**: Query times, connection pool
- **User Metrics**: Active users, conversion rates

### Alerting Setup
- Critical errors: Immediate notification
- Performance degradation: 5-minute alerts
- Resource limits: 15-minute warnings
- Business metrics: Daily summaries

### Log Management
- Centralized logging system
- Log rotation and archival
- Structured logging format
- Privacy and compliance considerations

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- **Database Backups**: Daily automated backups with weekly full backups
- **File Backups**: Application files and user uploads
- **Configuration Backups**: Environment variables and settings
- **Code Backups**: Git repository mirrors

### Recovery Procedures
- **Point-in-time Recovery**: Database restoration to specific timestamp
- **Full System Recovery**: Complete infrastructure rebuild
- **Partial Recovery**: Individual component restoration
- **Data Recovery**: User data and file restoration

### Testing Recovery
- Monthly recovery testing
- Document recovery procedures
- Train team on recovery processes
- Validate backup integrity

## Security Maintenance

### Regular Security Tasks
- **Dependency Updates**: Weekly security patch reviews
- **Access Audits**: Monthly user access reviews
- **SSL Certificate Management**: Automated renewal monitoring
- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly security assessments

### Incident Response
- **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
- **Assessment**: Severity classification and impact analysis
- **Containment**: Isolation of affected systems
- **Recovery**: System restoration and validation
- **Post-Incident**: Root cause analysis and improvements

## Performance Optimization

### Regular Performance Tasks
- **Database Optimization**: Index analysis and query optimization
- **CDN Management**: Cache invalidation and optimization
- **Code Optimization**: Performance profiling and improvements
- **Infrastructure Scaling**: Capacity planning and scaling

### Performance Monitoring Tools
- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**: New Relic, DataDog, or similar
- **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Track actual user experience
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: Automated testing from various locations
- **Log Analysis**: Performance insights from application logs
