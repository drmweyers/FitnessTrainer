## Key Decisions to Make

### Technical Decisions
1. **Hosting Platform**: AWS, GCP, Azure, or Vercel/Netlify?
2. **Database Hosting**: Managed (RDS) or self-hosted?
3. **Mobile Strategy**: React Native confirmed or native?
4. **State Management**: Redux, Zustand, or Context API?
5. **CSS Framework**: Tailwind, Material-UI, or custom?

### Business Decisions
1. **Pricing Model**: Commission-based or subscription?
2. **Launch Strategy**: Beta users or full launch?
3. **Target Market**: Geographic focus?
4. **Marketing Strategy**: How to acquire first trainers?

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Exercise Database Size**: Plan CDN strategy early
- **Offline Sync Complexity**: Build POC first
- **Payment Integration**: Start Stripe integration early
- **Mobile Performance**: Profile and optimize regularly

### Business Risks
- **User Acquisition**: Plan marketing alongside development
- **Competition**: Regular competitive analysis
- **Compliance**: GDPR, HIPAA considerations
- **Scalability**: Design for growth from day one

## Success Metrics to Track

### Development Metrics
- Sprint velocity
- Code coverage (target: >80%)
- Bug discovery rate
- Performance benchmarks

### Business Metrics (Post-Launch)
- User sign-ups
- Trainer activation rate
- Client engagement
- Revenue per trainer
- Churn rate

## Recommended Timeline

**Months 1-2**: Foundation & Authentication
**Months 3-4**: Core trainer features
**Months 5-6**: Client experience & mobile
**Month 7**: Testing, polish, and launch prep
**Month 8**: Beta launch

## Next Immediate Actions

- API testing tool (Postman/Insomnia)
- Monitoring tools

### Budget Considerations
- Development team salaries
- Cloud infrastructure (~$500-2000/month)
- Third-party services (~$200-500/month)
- Design tools and software licenses
- Marketing budget for launch

## Questions to Answer

Before starting development:
1. What's your budget and timeline?
2. Are you building solo or with a team?
3. Do you have design resources?
4. What's your go-to-market strategy?
5. Who are your first beta users?

## Conclusion

You have a solid foundation with the BMAD documents. The key now is to:
1. Start with the MVP features
2. Focus on trainer value first
3. Get to market quickly for feedback
4. Iterate based on user needs

Remember: Perfect is the enemy of done. Build the core features well, launch to beta users, and improve based on feedback.
