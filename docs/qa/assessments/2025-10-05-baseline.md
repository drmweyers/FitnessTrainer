# Baseline Test Assessment (2025-10-05)

Scope: Non-destructive discovery and initial coverage runs to establish a starting point aligned to BMAD gates.

Summary
- Frontend Jest: pending run results
- Backend Jest: pending run results (soft-fail allowed during Epic 002)
- Playwright E2E: executed for discovery (soft-fail allowed)
- Artifacts: coverage (frontend/backend), playwright-report, test-results

Discovery (initial)
- tests/ E2E specs present: client-management, exercise-library*, smoke
- Backend tests present under backend/tests/** and backend/src/tests/**

Risks & Notes
- E2E auth flows may fail until Epic 002 completes
- Backend integration tests may require DB/migrations in CI
- Coverage thresholds set at 70% globally as baseline; will be raised progressively

Next Steps
- Wire ephemeral DB in CI for backend tests
- Add minimal seed and test accounts
- Raise coverage thresholds post-Epic 002
Run Notes (local)
- Frontend Jest: config loads after fix, but ts-jest missing locally; unable to install due to EPERM. CI set to soft-fail until devDep is added.
- Backend Jest: tests discovered and executed; several failures related to auth controller signatures, module aliases, and email transporter init.
- Playwright: tests enumerated successfully across Chromium/Firefox/WebKit (list-only). E2E job set to soft-fail until Epic 002 completes.
