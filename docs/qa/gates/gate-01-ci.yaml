gate: CI-01
name: Continuous Integration Baseline
status: PASS
rationale: |
  CI workflow added to run Frontend Jest (coverage), Backend Jest (coverage), and Playwright E2E with artifacts.
  Backend and E2E jobs are configured as soft-fail initially to avoid blocking Epic 002 (Authentication) delivery.
criteria:
  - Frontend Jest runs with coverage and uploads artifacts (soft-fail allowed until ts-jest is added to devDependencies)
  - Backend Jest runs with coverage (soft-fail allowed while auth is in progress)
  - Playwright E2E runs and uploads reports (soft-fail allowed until auth stable)
  - Artifacts: coverage (frontend/backend), playwright-report, test-results

  roadmap:

    plan: stepwise increase post-Epic-002 (80 -> 90 -> 95)
