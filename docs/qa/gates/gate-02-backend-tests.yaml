gate: CI-02
name: Backend Tests Parity
status: CONCERNS
rationale: |
  Backend tests exist (backend/tests/**), but environment dependencies (DB, Prisma) may not be fully provisioned in CI yet.
  Job currently soft-fails to prevent blocking authentication work. Convert to hard-fail once Epic 002 stabilizes and DB is available in CI.
criteria:
  - Run backend Jest with coverage
  - Upload backend coverage artifact
  - No flaky tests (stabilize before hard-fail)
actions:
  - Add ephemeral DB (PostgreSQL) service in CI
  - Run migrations and seed for integration tests
  - Tighten coverage thresholds by module
